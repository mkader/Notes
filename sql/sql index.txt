index, how does it increaase faster?

only purpose of index is to make a search faster
By creating some things called B-tree or Balanced tree structure internally.

how data is searched when there are no indexed?
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,........50
SQl server called this kind of seaching as 'Table Scan'


it searchs Sequentially, one by one, until it reached 50, (almost it browse 49 records)

when you index data or column, what happens it create b-tree structure internally, data is divided into root node, non-leaf nodes, lead nodes.

   30 -    50
 10-30    40-50 
10 20 30  40 50
1  11 21  31 41 
...............			
10 20 30  40 50

SQL server called as Index seek or scan

example

order doesn't have any kind of index, it use table scan means searching sequentially
select * from orders where orderid = 10345


enable estiamted execution paln, you can see Table Scan

set statistics io on
 
Logical reads 3 for table scan

Now enable index for OrderId field

choose Type -index
Created As clustered or non-clusterd?
choose clusteered index

now run the query, you can see clustered index seek 
now run with,  set statistics io on
Logical reads 2 


clustered index
data is stored in the order of the clustered  index
only 1 clustered index per table
usually the primary key
no clustered  index = heap

non clustered index
data is not stored in the order of the non clustered  index
up to  999 per table
