You can use either a Command Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI) when using Linux. 
For repetitive tasks the CLI is often more efficient, while the GUI is easier to navigate

GNOME Desktop Environment GUI

It is bundled as the default desktop environment for many distributions including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CentOS, SUSE Linux Enterprise, and Debian. 
GNOME has menu-based navigation and is sometimes an easy transition for at least some Windows users. 

KDE, which is used by default in OpenSUSE.

Unity (from Ubuntu, based on GNOME), Xfce, and LXDE.


GUI Startup

When you install a desktop environment, the X display manager starts at the end of the boot process. This X display manager is responsible for starting the graphics system, logging in the user, and starting the user’s desktop environment. 

The default display manager for GNOME is called gdm. Other popular display managers include lightdm (used on Ubuntu) and kdm (associated with KDE).
